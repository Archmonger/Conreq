These instructions configure Non-Sucking Service Manager (NSSM) to automatically start Conreq as a Windows service.

A traditional Windows installer is targeted for development within our roadmap, but is currently not available.

### Software Required

-   Install [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    -   Make sure to select "Add Python 3.x to PATH" during installation.
    -   Easiest if this is the only version of python on your computer
    -   Steps below will not work with NSSM if using the "Windows App Store" version of Python.
-   Install [Visual Studio C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (Within this installer, navigate to _C++ Build Tools_. Select _MSVC_ and _Windows 10 SDK_)
-   Download [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/download)

### Installation

1. Create the folder `C:\Program Files\Conreq`
2. Use this folder to follow steps [setting up a Conreq environment](/Conreq/develop/run_conreq/#creating-a-production-environment), excluding steps involving `python manage.py run_conreq`.
3. Unzip NSSM in a separate directory where you can permanently keep it (ex. `C:\Program Files\NSSM`).
4. Open a terminal (ex. Command Prompt or PowerShell) within your NSSM directory **as administrator**.
5. Open NSSM by typing `.\win64\nssm.exe install Conreq`

    - ex) `C:\Program Files\Conreq\`
8. Under the Application tab, set "Arguments" to `manage.py run_conreq`
9. Click "Install Service".
10. In your terminal, type `.\win64\nssm.exe start Conreq`.
    - You can check to make sure its running as a service by running `nssm status Conreq`
