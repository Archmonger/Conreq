Conreq can store and serve any custom files located within your data directory's "static" folder.

In order to use this to serve custom CSS or JavaScript...

1. Put a CSS/JS file into `DATA_DIR/static/`
2. Restart Conreq
3. Set your Conreq "Custom CSS/JS" to link to the new content (ex. `/static/my_style.css`)
4. Done!
