These docs will be updated at a later time. Modal Rendering \u00b6 Modal rendering is currently being reassessed. These docs will be updated at a later time. HTTP URL Routing \u00b6 All of the HTTP routing logic will trace back to a views.py file. Within this file we write code render a specific URL address, which is effectively a string containing HTML. Conreq relies on the Django Framework for HTTP URL routing. Here's a high level example of what occurs when the browser visits a URL. The browser visits a Conreq web address Django determines how to handle this URL by comparing the path (let's use the example of /server_settings/ ) with what is contained in conreq/urls.py Django looks at conreq/urls.py at notices it points to include(\"conreq.core.server_settings.urls\") . So, this tells Django there is another file that defines this path, and that file is conreq/core/server_settings/urls.py . Based on the urlpatterns in conreq/core/server_settings/urls.py , Django determines this URL is rendered by a function called views.server_settings . Django runs this function to renders the HTML (known as a Django View ). The webserver determines how to send this view to the browser based on what was returned by the view (ex. a HttpResponse or JsonResponse ) Websockets \u00b6 Websockets can be thought of as the server and browser communicating via chat messages . When the page first loads, a connection to a chat room is formed, and chat bubbles can be communicated back and forth between the server and browser. Chat rooms must exist at a specific URL. The URL they exist at is determined within conreq/asgi.py . In this file, a specific URL is directly linked to a websocket consumer . A websocket consumer is a Python class with a send/receive function, which typically process json data. The data format that gets processed is determined based on your consumer's base class. For example AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer has send_json() and recieve_json() functions for processing JSON messages. Overriding these functions will be where most of your code will be written when working with websockets. In the situation where the server sends a JSON message via send_json() , it will be processed by the browser's JavaScript websocket client (ex. conreq/static/js/client_websockets.js ) .","title":"Our Code Explained"},{"location":"develop/code_tldr/#repository-file-structure","text":"Path Description manage.py Django development tool (runs the development web server, initialize the databases, and more. misc/ Branding, legal documents, and other miscellaneous files conreq/ Main Django application conreq/core/ All back-end functionality conreq/static/ CSS, JavaScript, and Image files conreq/utils/ Generic functions that may be helpful to use conreq/settings.py Boot-time configuration and settings conreq/urls.py HTTP URLs conreq/asgi.py Websocket URLs conreq/core/websockets/consumers.py Back-end Websockets conreq/static/js/client_websockets.js Front-end websockets","title":"Repository File Structure"},{"location":"develop/code_tldr/#viewport-rendering","text":"Viewport rendering is currently being reassessed.
