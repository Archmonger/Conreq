Conreq is a content requesting platform that allows users to request content from Sonarr/Radarr. It is designed to be a user-friendly interface for requesting content.

## Notice

Conreq is currently undergoing an architectural shift. The biggest change will be the addditional of an app store for adding/removing features to Conreq.

Included in the box will only be basic features such as user authentication/management. Features such as content requesting will be installable as apps.

As such, in the future Conreq will be designated as a web app platform.

See the [app store PR](https://github.com/Archmonger/Conreq/pull/295) for more details.
